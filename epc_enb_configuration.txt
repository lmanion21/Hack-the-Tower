THIS README COVERS INTEGRATION FOR SRSENB AND NEXTEPC

The two modules are integrated via a common IP address, in this case, it will be the outgoing IP address...

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

---NextEPC (Much of the instructions are covered in the installation guide)---

1.) run <ip addr> and figure out what the outgoing IP address is --- For this computer it should be the <wlp1s0> interface.
2.) all the points from which to update the ip address for nextEPC are found in /nextepc/install/etc/nextepc
3.) in mme.conf update line 17 with the outgoing ip address after <addr:>
4.) in sgw.conf update line 17 with the outgoing ip address after <addr:>

---srsENB---

5.) in order to access the enb.conf file for srsENB you need to have root privileges. To do this run <sudo su> and enter your password.
6.) navigate to /root/.config/srslte
7.) open enb.conf
8.) in enb.conf, you want to change settings in 3rd section (line 21 and on)
9.) comment out <tac = 0x0007> with <#>
10.) change <mme_addr = ...> to the outgoing ip address and ensure that it is not commented out
11.) change <s1c_bind_addr = ...> to the outgoing ip address and ensure that it is not commented out

---Testing---

12.) After running htt_startup program in nextEPC you should see the success message: <eNB-S1 accepted[...]> where the ellipses correspond to the outgoing ip address.
13.) For srsENB a successful test will output no error messages and < ==== eNodeB started === >
14.) If you receive an error on either interface troubleshoot accordingly.
