# Hack-the-Tower Overview

This Repoistory is the main working repository for USMA Hack the Tower.
Located here are scripts and instructions to set up a working 2G cell phone
tower using the nuande bladeRF and yatebts, and our continuation to 4G with srsLTE and NextEPC. The goal of this project is
to succesfully create or find exploits using a moblie base station.

## Code Overview
Under the "scripts" folder, you will find two installation options for installing the software for the 2G tower; one for Fedora and one for Ubuntu. Installation instructions are below for setting the 2G tower up with a BladeRF software defined radio. 
The remaining files in the main repository contain the software for the 4G tower, which can also be utilized with the BladeRF software defined radio. The tower is a combination of srsLTE and NextEPC, and is currently configured for Wren_cadets. 


## XE401 Hack the Tower Repo (2G)
### Instructions:
1. First, we must run our scripts. Start by navigating to running `./pkg_install.sh` and `./yatebts_install` under the correct OS.
2. Next, we need to lod the image and the firmware onto the bladeRF. 
    1. `bladeRF-cli -l <path to fpga>`
    2. `bladeRF-cli -f <load firmware>`
3. now we need to compile yate software. Navigate to yate folder 
    1. `./autogen.sh`
    2. `./configure --prefix=/usr/local`
    3. `make -j4`
    4. `sudo make install`
    6. `sudo ldconfig`
4. Navigate to yatebts folder 
    1. `./autogen.sh`
    2. `./configure --prefix=/usr/local`
    3. `make -j4`
    4. `sudo make install`
    6. `sudo ldconfig`
5. Now we will set up the yatebts web server.
    1. `cd /var/www/html/`
    2. `sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/yate/nib_web nib`
    3. `sudo chmod -R a+w /usr/local/etc/yate`
6. See if your server is up and running by navigating to `http://ip-of-your-rpi/nib` on your web browser.
7. Start your base station 
    1. `sudo yate -s`

## 4G LTE with srsLTE

## Build Guide
1. Install on Ubuntu with: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:srslte/releases
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install srslte -y

The srsLTE suite includes:
srsUE - a complete SDR LTE UE (User Equipment) application
srsENB - a complete SDR LTE eNodeB (Basestation) application
srsEPC - a light-weight LTE EPC (Core Network) implementation with MME, HSS and S/P-GW

srsLTE documentation: https://docs.srslte.com/en/latest/

2. Replace the srsEPC with NextEPC
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nextepc/nextepc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install nextepc

Install Web Interface: 
sudo apt-get -y install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
curl -sL https://nextepc.org/static/webui/install | sudo -E bash -

Verify the Installation: 
sudo systemctl status nextepc-mmed
‚óè nextepc-mmed.service - NextEPC MME Daemon

## 4G Tower Start Up
1.) If your computer already has the bladeRF, nextEPC, and srsENB software already installed, run the htt_startup_x115.sh script. Otherwise ensure that your software is installed first. Specific instructions are written in the comments of the script on where to find everything.
2.) Once you've got a phone connected, run the inet_startup.sh script to auto-configure the ip tables and open up the pgwtun interface to traffic.
